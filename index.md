## 🛡️ Privacy Policy
**Last Updated: February 2026**

XDFamily was built from the ground up to ensure your data stays where it belongs: on your device.

* **Local-First Storage**: All family tree data, including names, relationships, and notes, is stored strictly on your local device's internal database.
* **Photo Privacy**: When you add a family portrait, the app saves a copy to its local internal storage. We do not transmit, upload, or share your photos with any external servers.
* **No Data Collection**: We do not use third-party tracking or analytics. We have no access to your family tree data.
* **Data Portability**: You own your data. You can export your entire tree to a JSON file for your own backups at any time.

## Child Safety Standards
XDFamily developed by Wanaku Verdzekov has a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE).
Although XDFamily is a local-only application that does not transmit data to external servers, we explicitly prohibit the use of this application to create, store, or distribute any material that facilitates the exploitation or abuse of children, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).
We comply with all applicable child safety laws and will report any confirmed instances of CSAM to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) or relevant local authorities.
