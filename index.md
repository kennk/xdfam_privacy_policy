* **Local-First Storage**: All family tree data, including names, relationships, and notes, is stored strictly on your local device's internal database.
* **Photo Privacy**: When you add a family portrait, the app saves a copy to its local internal storage. We do not transmit, upload, or share your photos with any external servers.
